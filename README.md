# EncryptionAlgorithms
The most widely used encryption algorithms today include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), DH (Diffie-Hellman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

<h1>These are simple examples, what I want to do is to create a encryption tool using the formulas used by Ibn Arabi, al-Jabr and Omar Khayyam.</h1>
